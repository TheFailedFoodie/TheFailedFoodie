- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheFailedFoodie
- 👀 I’m interested in getting my degree and playing video games. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, C, Javascript, HTML5, CSS, and anything else I feel will help me
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I am a relatively new programmer.
- 📫 How to reach me. Good luck, I am notorious for being hard to get a hold of. If you want the best possible chance, try my Discord, The Failed Foodie#2983. Probably let me know where u got my info or I'll block you.
